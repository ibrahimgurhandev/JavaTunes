JavaTunes is a console based music player that lets you play classic songs right in your terminal. The user can select to search by genre, or see all the songs available in our playlist. They can then select a song, and once the song loads, they are shown some player controls. The player controls give the user the option to play, pause,restart, and go back to song selection area.
